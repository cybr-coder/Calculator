## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42. **Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).**

- Answers should be rounded with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
- Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

- HTML Global Attributes
- CSS Grid layout
- CSS Variables 
- Advanced DOM Manipulation 
- .matches() method and the .target property.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development
- Improve the look and feel of the project.
- Add edge cases to the calculator functionality.


### Useful resources

- [CSS TRICKS](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me to learn CSS grids for layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Jaybees TechTalk](https://www.youtube.com/@jaybeestechtalk) - This is an amazing YouTube channel which helped me understand a lot of concepts, He did the same curriculum(TOP) and documented everything so when I'm stuck, I just visit his channel.
